# Advanced-Techniques-in-Machine-Learning-and-Deep-Learning
Advanced Techniques in ML and DL is a mandatory course to be taken at NYU for Data Science majors. The course provides a practical introduction to tools and techniques for different stages of machine learning life-cycle from model development to post-deployments. By studying varying techniques such neural network training, hyperparamter optimization, feature engineering, and neural architecture search, I gained a vast amount of knowledge of automated ML tools like auto-sklearn, auto-WEKA and H20.ai. Beyond model development, the class introduced me to various tools for creating robust models, explaining model predictions, conducting bias and fairness audits, detecting post-deployment model drift, and continual training. The assignments provided in this repository show hands-on extensive tools and techniques involving ML and DL frameworks (Tensorflow, PyTorch) as well as open-source technologies.
